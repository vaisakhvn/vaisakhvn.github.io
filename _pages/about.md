I am Vaisakh V Namboothiri, a Grade 11 student and an aspiring AI researcher from Kerala, India. I treat learning as a long-term craft, blending academic rigor with hands-on engineering. My work bridges the gap between full-stack development and artificial intelligence, with a focus on building tools that foster critical thinking rather than passive consumption. I will be focusing more on AI research in the coming years.
